## Notes

The purpose of this application was to complete a pre-assessment to enroll into CodePath's remote iOS developer course for Fall 2020. I was able to learn how Xcode
looks and feels and I dabbled a bit with the Swift programming language and it's syntax. I have more expertise in backend Java development using the IntelliJ IDE
and so, this project helped in understanding the basics of Xcode and Swift.

One of the major challenges I faced was integrating the application with Github. It was my first time figuring this out through Xcode and I soon realized how 
seamless it is to create repositories and push and pull commits through Xcode itself.
